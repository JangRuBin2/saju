description: Create implementation plan before coding. WAIT for user confirmation before touching any code.
---

Invoke the **planner** agent to create a comprehensive implementation plan.

1. Restate requirements clearly
2. Identify affected layers (engine, llm, services, routers)
3. Break down into phases with specific file paths
4. Assess risks and dependencies
5. Define testing strategy
6. WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

Use `/plan` before any complex feature, refactoring, or architectural change.
